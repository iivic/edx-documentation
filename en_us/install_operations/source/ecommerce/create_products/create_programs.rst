Programs are collections of related courses. Learners enroll in a program by
enrolling in any course that is part of a program, and earn a program
certificate by passing each of the courses in the program with a grade that
qualifies them for a verified certificate.

You add programs in the Django Administration site for your Open edX instance.

To add a program, follow these steps.

#. Sign into the Django administration site.

#. In the **Course Metadata** section, select **Programs**.

#. Select **Add Program**.

#. On the **Add Program** page, a UUID is assigned to the new program.

#. Enter the information for the new program. Required fields, for example
   **Title** and **Status** have boldface names.

.. note:: To allow learners to purchase upgrades to the verified track for all
   the courses in the program with one click, select **One click purchase
   enabled**.

#. When you have finished entering information for the program, select one of
   the **Save** options: **Save**, **Save and add another**, or **Save and
   continue editing**.
