Programs are collections of courses. Learners enroll in a program by enrolling
in any course that is part of a program, and earn a program certificate by
passing each of the courses in the program with a grade that qualifies them for
a verified certificate.

You add programs in the Django Administration site for your Open edX instance.

To add a program, follow these steps.

#. Sign into the Django administration site.

#. In the **Course Metadata** section, select **Programs**.
